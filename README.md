# ptv-api-test-objc

This is an application that calls the healthcheck endpoint on Public Transport Victoria's Timetable API, and displays the results on the screen. It was architected using MVVM, and unit tests for all of the PTVHealthCheckService methods have been set up, except for the NSData to model processing. A live integration of the PTVHealthCheckService has also been implemented.
